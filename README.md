This is my first real git project so expect a lot of jank in all areas!

I made this little bowling game in Godot with the intent on turning it into a clicker game.
The base bowling mechanics are fun enough to warrant seperating before I add the math clusterfuck.
Currently I'm chasing down a bug that's not registering spares when they happen.
And after tracking down all the nodes and scripts I added since it worked I thought to myself,
"Man, this would be really easy if I could just go back to the older, working version."
And that brings us square up to speed. Bugs still there, but when I squash it I'll hopfully
have a version that I'm comfortable having forked. I mean, you could fork it now if you want, but 
realistically, if you're on this website in any capacity you're probably skilled enough to  build 
this two week project in about an hour.

Now I'm off to work at my grocery store job.
