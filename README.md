v0.3 - Some base functionality for the "Clicker" game

This update finally included some of the basics for the actual game I started making. It didn't
occur to me when I started this project that I'm essentially making two games nested on top of each other, 
but here we are. Now, if you get enough gutterballs, an option to buy the ability to control the curve of
the ball appears, allowing for more control. I also made some small changes to the spare and strike animations
based on some feedback.

Next steps are to implement similar buying buttons for ball speed and ball starting location, then a few buttons
to increase the points earned from pins, spares, and strikes. Then I need to create a start menu, a win condition,
and a regular version of bowling with all the point functionality replaced with the classic 10-frames scoring.

v0.01 - This is my first real git project so expect a lot of jank in all areas!

I made this little bowling game in Godot with the intent on turning it into a clicker game.
The base bowling mechanics are fun enough to warrant seperating before I add the math clusterfuck.
Currently I'm chasing down a bug that's not registering spares when they happen.
And after tracking down all the nodes and scripts I added since it worked I thought to myself,
"Man, this would be really easy if I could just go back to the older, working version."
And that brings us square up to speed. Bugs still there, but when I squash it I'll hopfully
have a version that I'm comfortable having forked. I mean, you could fork it now if you want, but 
realistically, if you're on this website in any capacity you're probably skilled enough to  build 
this two week project in about an hour.

Now I'm off to work at my grocery store job.
